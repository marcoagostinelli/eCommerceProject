[^3]: In order to track a delivery a seller must have shipped a product and entered the delivery information. This should be a story as well.
[^4]: How do you plan on generating the suggestions? Is there a mechanism that you can readily choose to generate them or are they input by the site admins?
Suggestions will be generated after a client makes their first purchase. It will contain random products from the category that the client has bought from
